# Hate Speech Classification

* Find Dataset to train, ideal if hate is labeled
* Test with "ambiguous data," (Twitter, Reddit, Craigslist, Quora)
* Each comes up with a model to use
    - Nick: Logistsic
    - Ben: Naive Baye's
    - Juan: XGBoost
    - Chris: Random Forest
    - Vighnesh: KNN
    - Misc.: Ridge, Lasso
    - Batch Gradient Descent: Randomly take batch (subset of row) and compute gradient on subset of data
 
* Use Hate BERT for each of our models.
* Write code that brings all ROCs together from regular model and Hate Bert model. (so two graphs each showing multiple ROCs)
* Then created stacked models, one for regular and one for hate BERT
* Then get confusion matrix for each stacked model in order to give a final comparison between Hate Bert and regular

# Problem
In this project, we compare the performance of various classification models in their ability to detect hate speech. These include Logistic Regression (with L1, L2, and no penalty), KNN, RandomForest Classifier, XGBoost, and GaussianNB. Specifically, we train the models with a large dataset of phrases that are already classified as hate speech or not. We then test the models on a separata dataset of phrases to see how well they can identify hate speech. Broadly, we compare their detection abilities using a $all-MiniLM-L6-v2$ sentence transformer model, and later find an optimal stacking of the models.

# Data Sources and Collection Methods
Our training dataset was created by Vidgen et.al (2021), found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tasksource/dynahate). This consists of over 41,000 comments that are defined as either "hate" or "not hate". The source for the test data comes from the ETHOS Hate Speech Dectection dataset, found [here](https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Ethos-Hate-Speech-Dataset/blob/master/ethos/ethos_data/Ethos_Dataset_Binary.csv). This dataset scrapes 998 comments from YouTube and Reddit and contains the likelihood of whether a comment is hate speech or not.

# Instructions for Reproducibility
To obtain the training data, download `hugging_face_data.py` file from the Hugging Face dataset, place into the code folder, and run the `csv_creator.py` file in the code folder. To obtain the test data, download the `Ethos_Dataset_Binary.csv` file from the attached test repository, place into the data folder, then run the `clean_data.py` code in the code folder to change the format and file name. To run the models, their respective codes can be ran in the code folder to obtain the necessary information on each model.

# Models Used

When looking at the ROC curves for the seven models using the $all-MiniLM-L6-v2$ sentence transformer, we see all the Logistic-based models have the best AUC with 0.79.

When looking at the Precision-Recall curves for the seven models using the $all-MiniLM-L6-v2$ sentence transformer, we see there is a four-way tie between the Logistic-based and the XGBoost models with an Average Precision of 0.78.

## hateBERT

When looking at the ROC curves for the seven models uisng the $hateBERT$ sentence transformers, we see all the Logistic-based models have the best AUC with 0.79, which is the same as the the previous transformer we saw.

When looking at the Precision-Recall curves for the seven models using the $hateBERT$ sentence transformer, the Logistic-based models do best  with an Average Precision of 0.78, which is the same as the the previous transformer we saw.

# Model Selection
Due to its performance on the ROC and Precision-Recall curves for both sentence transformers, the logistic-based models all equally do well.

# Data Limitations
Our major limitation is that we are unable to detect any possible hate speech that contains sarcasm, as our models are not specifically trained on that. Furthermore, we are unable to capture the full context of the comment. For example, we may have replies for a certain tweet but may not necessarily have information of the tweet itself so that context is ignored. Similarly, much of the hate speech online nowadays is heavily coded and abstract to the point where the data we tested on would not be able to pick up on the subtleties that could be found.

</p>

A major limitation for the models is the computation time, as some of these models run for at least 20 minutes to obtain output. The Hate BERT models specifically tend to hava a higher rate of false positive, where it marks 'Hate' for phrases that are not. This is likely due to Hate BERT being trained on a large dataset of extreme hate speech. We also do not stack models due to the computation time for the attempts we had on creating.
